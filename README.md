The Task Management App is a mobile application built using Flutter and Bloc state management, designed to help users efficiently create, track, and manage tasks. The app allows users to add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed, along with assigning tasks to specific users. It features local storage with SQLite for offline task management and API integration for user authentication and task synchronization.

Technologies Used:
Flutter – Cross-platform framework for Android & iOS development.
Dart – Primary programming language for Flutter.
Bloc (flutter_bloc) – State management for better app performance and scalability.
SQLite (sqflite package) – Local database for offline storage.
REST APIs – Integrated APIs for authentication and user data (e.g., ReqRes API).
Firebase App Distribution (Optional) – For sharing test builds before release.
This project was created for learning purposes, focusing on clean code architecture, error handling, and performance optimization.
